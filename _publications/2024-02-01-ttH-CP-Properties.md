excerpt: 'The *CP* properties of the coupling between the Higgs boson and the top quark are investigated using \\(139 fb^{-1}\\) of proton–proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of \\(\sqrt{s}=13\\)TeV. The *CP* structure of the top quark–Higgs boson Yukawa coupling is probed in events with a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of b-quarks and produced in association with either a pair of top quarks, \\(t\bar{t}H\\), or a single top quark, \\(tH\\). Events containing one or two electrons or muons are used for the measurement. Multivariate techniques are used to select regions enriched in \\(t\bar{t}H\\) and \\(tH\\) events, where dedicated *CP*-sensitive observables are exploited. In an extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a *CP*-odd admixture in the top–Higgs Yukawa coupling, the mixing angle between *CP*-even and *CP*-odd couplings is measured to be \\(\alpha = {11^\circ}^{+52^{\circ}}_{-73^{\circ}}\\), compatible with the SM prediction corresponding to \\(\alpha=0^\circ\\).'

This paper discusses the main analysis that I contributed to as part of my PhD, performed as part of the ATLAS collaboration. The paper was published in [Phys. Lett. B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269324000285?ref=cra_js_challenge&fr=RR-1) in Febuary 2024.  

## Overview 
---
This paper performs the first measurement of the *CP* properties of the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling in the $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ decay channel. Violation of *CP* symmetry a necissary part of explaining the matter-antimatter assymmetry in the universe.

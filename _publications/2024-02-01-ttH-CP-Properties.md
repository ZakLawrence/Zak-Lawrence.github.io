excerpt: 'The *CP* properties of the coupling between the Higgs boson and the top quark are investigated using \\(139 fb^{-1}\\) of proton–proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of \\(\sqrt{s}=13\\)TeV. The *CP* structure of the top quark–Higgs boson Yukawa coupling is probed in events with a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of b-quarks and produced in association with either a pair of top quarks, \\(t\bar{t}H\\), or a single top quark, \\(tH\\). Events containing one or two electrons or muons are used for the measurement. Multivariate techniques are used to select regions enriched in \\(t\bar{t}H\\) and \\(tH\\) events, where dedicated *CP*-sensitive observables are exploited. In an extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a *CP*-odd admixture in the top–Higgs Yukawa coupling, the mixing angle between *CP*-even and *CP*-odd couplings is measured to be \\(\alpha = {11^\circ}^{+52^{\circ}}_{-73^{\circ}}\\), compatible with the SM prediction corresponding to \\(\alpha=0^\circ\\).'

This paper discusses the main analysis that I contributed to as part of my PhD, performed as part of the ATLAS collaboration. The paper was published in [Phys. Lett. B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269324000285?ref=cra_js_challenge&fr=RR-1) in February 2024.  

## Overview
Within this paper, we studied the one of the most fundamental interactions in particle physics, that being how the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) couples to the [top quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark). The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle in the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) and so has the strongest interaction strength with the Higgs boson. Understanding this relationship is crucial as it can help us understand if the laws of physics behave exactly as predicted in the Standard Model, or if there are hints of new physics to be discovered. 

Specifically we investigated if this interaction respects [**CP-symmetry**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation), a property that if violated could help explain why the universe is comprised predominantly of [matter rather than antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry). A "$CP$-odd" contribution to the top-Higgs coupling would be a clear sign of physics beyond the Standard Model.

Using the **ATLAS detector** at **CERN's Large Hadron Collider**, we analysed the full Run 2 dataset (collected between 2015-2018), focusing on events where the Higgs boson is produced alongside one or two top quarks and then decays into a pair of [bottom quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_quark). These events are rare and challenging to identify, so we employed advanced machine learning techniques to separate the signal from the background and to build observables that are sensitive to the $CP$ nature of the interaction.

Our analysis measured the possible mixing between the standard $CP$-even Higgs interaction and a potential $CP$-odd component. The results showed no evidence of a significant $CP$-odd contribution, with the data being consistent with the Standard Model expectations. However our measurement placed stronger constraints on how large such new physics effects could be in the top-Higgs interaction. 

This study helps deepen our understanding of the Higgs boson, and helps us to close the gap between theory and unanswered questions about the nature of the universe.

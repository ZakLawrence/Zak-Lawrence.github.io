Hi there ðŸ‘‹
======
I'm currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher on the [CMS](https://cms.cern) experiment at [CERN](https://home.cern)! I'm based at [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en) in Belgium, where I work a memeber of [CP3](https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/public/member/814/en) on measurements targeting the interaction between the top quark and Higgs boson. As part of my research I am working on the development of machine learning tools to identify hadronically decaying top quarks, tools for monitoring the radiation damage in the silicon strip tracker. I am also responsible for organising seminarsw within the CP3 group so feel free to get in contact if you have something you'd like to present! 

:briefcase: Profesional History
======
Perviously I worked as a PhD student at the [University of Manchester](https://www.hep.manchester.ac.uk), where I was a member of the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern) experiment. During my PhD my research focused on the CP properties of the top-Higgs coupling. Within this role I worked as one of the lead analysers of the first measurement performed at the LHC of the CP properties in the channel where the Higgs decays to a pair of bottom quarks. You can find more infomation about this analysis and the role I played in it on the [Publications page](https://zaklawrence.github.io/Zak-Lawrence.github.io/publications/). Alongside my main analysis work I was involved in calibrating the tagging algorithms used within ATLAS using the \\(p_T^\mathrm{rel}\\) method. Again see the [Publications page](https://zaklawrence.github.io/Zak-Lawrence.github.io/publications/) for more details.

When Iâ€™m not working, youâ€™ll usually find me outdoors â€” I love running, hiking, and cycling. Iâ€™m also a big fan of reading, and I enjoy getting together with friends for board games or a good D&D campaign.
